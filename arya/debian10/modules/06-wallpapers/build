# Arya uses wallpaper from /usr/share/wallpapers/slax_wallpeper.jpg
# So we are going to replace this file
# First, create a temporary module tree
# Note that the directory itself has .sb extension
DIR=/tmp/wallpaper.sb
mkdir $DIR
mkdir -p $DIR/usr/share/wallpapers/

# Now copy wallpaper file to that directory
cat logo.jpg > $DIR/usr/share/wallpapers/logo.jpg

# Finally, convert the module directory to a file
# The directory will be erased and module file with the same name will be created
dir2sb $DIR
